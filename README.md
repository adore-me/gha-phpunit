# gha-phpunit

## Description
Run phpunit with custom PHP image.  
â„¹ The PHP image used can be passed through `php-image` input or through `PROJECT_IMAGE` env variable.  
**NOTE:** If you use [gha-image-setup](https://github.com/adore-me/gha-image-setup) in a previous step you don't need to worry about it, as it already sets the `PROJECT_IMAGE` ðŸ‘Œ    
**Input** takes precedence!  
It expects the project to have a `.env.testing.ci` file with the environment variables needed for the tests to run.

## Outputs
None.

## Notes
â„¹ This action doesn't handle docker registry authentication (e.g. for private images).
You can run [docker/login-action@v1](https://github.com/docker/login-action) before this step.  
â„¹ If **MySql** is enabled `migrations` and `seeds` will run automatically.  
â„¹ It uses [publish-unit-test-result-action](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action) for publishing test results.  
â„¹ It uses [comment-coverage-clover](https://github.com/lucassabreu/comment-coverage-clover) for publishing code coverage.

Automatically handles uploading artifacts to GitHub Actions.

## Notes on using coverage
âš  If `with-coverage` is set to `pcov`, it will automatically append the `-coverage` suffix to the PHP image tag (internally, this image extends the production image, and just adds `pcov` extension).  
NOTE: Make sure there is a `-coverage` image for the PHP image you are using.

âš  If `with-coverage` is set to `true`, it will automatically append the `-dev` suffix to the PHP image tag (internally, this image has xdebug, needed for coverage report).  
Otherwise, it will use the image tag as is (without xdebug), for faster running time.

## Notes on configuring `.env`
âš  Configuring the `.env` should be done through `.env.testing` file. 
Laravel PHPUnit already sets the env to `testing` so it will be used automatically (we also set it on containers as env variables source: `--env-file .env.testing`). 

Other tests related configurations should be done through `phpunit.xml` file.   
This way we avoid duplicating functionality, and you can run the same setup locally.

ðŸ—’ **List of default config values**

**MySql**
- host: `mysql.gha`
- database: `adoreme`
- user: `adoreme`
- password: `secret`

**Redis**
- host: `redis.gha`

### Example of step configuration and usage:
For the most basic usage (fallback on all defaults) you can just add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run PHPUnit'
    uses: adore-me/phpunit-action@master
```

If you want to override some defaults you can do it like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run PHPUnit Install'
    uses: adore-me/phpunit-action@master
    with:
      php-image: SOME_IMAGE # Should be a fully qualified image tag (e.g. `quay.io/adore-me/nginx-fpm-alpine:php-7.4.3-c2-v1.1.1`)
      reports-dir: 'build/reports'
      phpunit-report-file-name: phpunit-junit.xml
      enable-mysql: true
      enable-redis: true
      enable-workers: true
      workers-conf-path: ci/worker-confs/supervisor_dev_test_workers.conf
      with-coverage: 'pcov'
      coverage-report-file-name: coverage-clover.xml
      run-suites: 'IntegrationTests,UnitTests'
```

#### Using min-line-coverage and min-method-coverage
In order to implement required code coverage, you can use this 2 options:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run PHPUnit Install'
    uses: adore-me/phpunit-action@master
    with:
      php-image: SOME_IMAGE # Should be a fully qualified image tag (e.g. `quay.io/adore-me/nginx-fpm-alpine:php-7.4.3-c2-v1.1.1`)
      reports-dir: 'build/reports'
      phpunit-report-file-name: phpunit-junit.xml
      enable-mysql: true
      enable-redis: true
      enable-workers: true
      workers-conf-path: ci/worker-confs/supervisor_dev_test_workers.conf
      with-coverage: 'pcov'
      coverage-report-file-name: coverage-clover.xml
      run-suites: 'IntegrationTests,UnitTests'
      min-lin-coverage: 30
      min-method-coverage: 30
```
